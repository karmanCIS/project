<p>
Amen Thompson fits like a glove for Houston. They add another superstar athlete, they get their elite playmaker to help all of their awesome shot creators. Ausar Thompson may not be a 100% perfect flashy fit for Detroit .. but he was still an amazing choice. Ausar's scoring craft, handling and passing upside and defensive ceiling pair well with Cade and Ivey and Duren.    </p>
